A platformer game designed and programmed for my A level Computing coursework. It was programmed in Java and uses the LWJGL and Slick2D.

Download zip files for a taster at what the game was like to play. Some levels (simply level design, not coding) are incomplete and may contain bugs. This is just to give you a quick trial of the game.
